# <Pre-work Study Guide Website>

## Description

-Creating this project of a study guide website was to help me learn the basics of coding and where to start.
-The website will also be available for others globally to learn and hopefully spark interest in what a carrer as a developer could look like with an interesting and informative webpage.
-I want the study guide to give quick and easy access for new developers to get the idea of what basic formats of code are and what they can help you develop, the topics my study guide helps people learn about are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also have some helpful information about git basics to help new developers easily find those repetative task that every developer should know by heart.
-The website will help new developers have an easily accesible notes page for the basics and intro to develpment in coding, someone who has never even attempted to code can look at the webpage and easily find the basics they need to know about a few languages of code.
-Creating my website has had its challenges even with just the basics, ive learned how to access a terminal in mac as linex and in windows through git bash.
-Ive developed skills in how to use a remote repository with github and the necessary steps to push and pull code onto a local computer.
-Being able to create branches to work on certain features without interupting or messing up the main branch was a great step for me learn as a new developer so i can return and fix any mistakes that arise.
-I had some issues with creating a file with my main branch because i copied a file a few times with the same name and it got confusing trying to navigate through so many files, i got some help to create a new repo with the same files and keep my work I added in those files. I quickly learned afterwards that i lost all of my previous commits so i couldnt revert to my older saves, luckily I didn't need to go back to any old saves but it taught me the importants of setting up repos accurately the first time, and to not delete repos before a project is done even if i inteded to work on a new one. I also lost my issues I had created for my project and had to remake them which was a little anoying but gave me some extra experience on creating the right headings and formats for issues so it wasnt all bad.
- I took the time to setup my desktop (windows) and my laptop (mac) to connect to my github account and learned that you need different ssh keys for each computer but in the end i was able to quickly switch between computers and have all my updated work appear on either by pulling from my remote repository.
-Creating the website for my prework helped me establish the basics of using a repo for projects and being able to use a terminal to talk to the shell of a computer.
Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
