# <Pre-work Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

The motivation behind developing this study guide webpage was to gain a foundational understanding of coding and its essential components. The webpage is not only intended to aid me but also benefit others as a resource available worldwide that can serve as an inspiration for aspiring developers. The goal is to provide condensed and easy access to fundamental coding concepts, specifically HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while also offering practical advice on git basics.

The webpage aims to provide a comprehensive yet accessible guide for new developers seeking to gain familiarity with coding. Even those with no prior experience in coding can use the webpage to gain a basic understanding of coding languages.

I encountered several challenges throughout the development process, such as navigating through numerous files with similar names, creating accurate repos, and setting up different ssh keys for each computer. Even though I struggled with these issues, the experiences taught valuable lessons on the significance of creating accurate repos, maintaining records, and effectively structuring issues.

The webpage has proven to be an instrumental tool for learning the essentials of coding, including the use of a terminal to communicate with the computer's shell, as well as how to establish remote repositories using GitHub. Through the development process, I gained valuable skills in creating branches and the knowledge for effectively collaborating with team members, ensuring that the main branch was not affected during development. In the end, the creation of this study guide webpage not only serves as a valuable resource for new developers but also demonstrates the importance of persevering through the challenges of development.
